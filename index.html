        <h1 id="about"> About </h1>
        <h2 id="description"> Daniel Handler is the author of seven novels, including Why We Broke Up, We Are Pirates, All The Dirty Parts and, most recently, Bottle Grove. As Lemony Snicket, he is responsible for numerous books for children, including the thirteen-volume A Series of Unfortunate Events, the four-volume All the Wrong Questions, and The Dark, which won the Charlotte Zolotow Award. Mr. Snicket’s first book for readers of all ages, Poison for Breakfast, will be published by Liveright/W.W. Norton on August 31, 2021. Handler has received commissions from the San Francisco Symphony, Berkeley Reperatory Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and has collaborated with artist Maira Kalman on a series of books for the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and with musicians Stephin Merritt (of the Magnetic Fields), Benjamin Gibbard (of Death Cab for Cutie), Colin Meloy (of the Decemberists) and Torquil Campbell (of Stars).

    His books have sold more than 70 million copies and have been translated into 40 languages, and have been adapted for film, stage and television, including the recent adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events for which he was awarded both the Peabody and the Writers Guild of America awards. He lives in San Francisco with the illustrator Lisa Brown, to whom he is married and with whom he has collaborated on several books and one son.</h2>
        <br>
        <h2 id="description2">Handler was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Sandra Handler (née Walpole), a retired City College of San Francisco Dean; and Louis Handler, an accountant. His father was a Jewish refugee from Germany. His mother is distantly related to British writer Hugh Walpole. In terms of his early religious upbringing, Handler said, "I had a fairly standard Reform Jewish upbringing, I guess, in terms of the religious side of it." He has a younger sister, Rebecca Handler. Handler has been a voracious reader since childhood, and his favorite author was William Maxwell. He attended Commodore Sloat Elementary, Herbert Hoover Middle School, and Lowell High School. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1992. He was awarded the 1992 Connecticut Student Poet Prize, which he claims was earned by ripping off Elizabeth Bishop. He is an alumnus of the San Francisco Boys Chorus.

He is married to Lisa Brown, an illustrator whom he met in college. They have a son, Otto Handler, born in 2003. They live in an Edwardian house in San Francisco.

Handler revealed ambivalence toward his wealth and the expectations that it creates in the June 10, 2007 edition of The New York Times Magazine. He emphasized that he often donates money to charitable causes.[15] Handler and his wife have also donated $1,000,000 to Planned Parenthood, and he has supported the Occupy Wall Street movement.

Handler describes himself as a secular humanist and an atheist. He describes himself as having developed a "feminist consciousness" while in college.</h2>
